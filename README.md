# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Project:
The purpose of this project is to design an app which allows a customer to search for a desirable vacation destination based on temperature preferences. The process begins by prompting the customer to input a minimum and maximum preferred temperature to establish a range in which to search for potential destinations. The app will then display a map with pop-up markers displaying all applicable cities and a nearby hotel to accomodate for lodging.

In addition to the functioning app, one example vacation itinerary based on the temperature range of 75-90Â°F is included as well. This itinerary shows the path one might take through the Spanish countryside, complete with pop-up markers displaying nearby lodging and the temperatures of each waypoint.
